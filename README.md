# Wumpus-World-Solver
This is my college project coded in C Language which is designed to solve the Wumpus World Problem.

Q : What is the Wumpus World Problem?
The Wumpus world problem deals with an AI robot navigating its way through a 4x4 puzzle to try and find gold. The robot must safely navigate its way around bottomless pits of death and evil Wumpus creatures to locate the gold hidden on the board. After it has successfully found the gold, it must safely navigate its way back to the starting point. The robot must use its light sensors and the signals sent to it at each square to determine which way to properly navigate to reach its goal.

As this Problem is a P=NP Problem. Therefore there is no exact solution. Thus, the complexity of the Code is exponential. 

There are a few assumptions made while creating the Wumpus World Solver:-
1. There cannot be a square in the Grid with Gold and Wumpus or Gold and Pit at the same spot.
2. The intial square is free of any inferences like Stench, Breeze or Glitter.
3. There is only one Wumpus and One Pit in the Grid.

Pls don't Judge this was my first Project :)
